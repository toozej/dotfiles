# dotfiles
Pretty self-explanatory, but here's my dotfiles. 

I use them in two ways:

1) Automatically setup during system provisioning with [my Ansible repo](github.com/toozej/ansible)
2) Manually with the setup.sh script from this repo. This also installs [my vimfiles](github.com/toozej/vimfiles)

Installation
============
`git clone https://github.com/toozej/dotfiles && ~/dotfiles/setup.sh`


Resources Used
==============
- git-template for making main the default branch: https://medium.com/dataseries/how-to-make-your-git-repos-default-to-main-instead-of-master-28b7a9d3d631
