# dotfiles
Pretty self-explanatory, but here's my dotfiles. 

I use them in two ways:

1) Automatically setup during system provisioning with [my Ansible repo](github.com/toozej/ansible)
2) Manually with the setup.sh script from this repo. This also installs [my vimfiles](github.com/toozej/vimfiles)

Installation
============
`git clone https://github.com/toozej/dotfiles && ~/dotfiles/setup.sh`
